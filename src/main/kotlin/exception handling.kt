/*
Exceptions in Kotlin
    Exception is an unwanted or an unexpected event which occur during execution of program (during runtime)
    This disrupts the normal flow of the program instructions.

Exception Handling in Kotlin
    All exception classes in Kotlin are descendents of the class Throwable. Every exception has a message,
    stack trace and an optional cause.
    Exception handling allows the execution of program even after exception
Kotlin supports unchecked exception (they are not explicitly declared in the function signatures)
