/*
KOTLIN ANNOTATIONS:
    ~ are means of attaching metadata to code.
    To declare an annotation, put the annotation modifier in front of a class

Types of Annotations in Kotlin:
    > Target:
        specifies possible kinds of elements that can be annotated with classes, function, their properties,
            their expression, way of behaviour etc.
    > Retention:
        specifies whether annotation is stored in compiled class files and whether its visible to the reflection.
            of the run time
    > Repeatable:
        allows using the same annotation on single element or variable multiple times.
    > MustBeDocumented:
        specifies that the annotation is a part of the public API and it should be included in a class or method
            signature which is in the generated API document.
            Significance: It has to include method or class in the generated API document
